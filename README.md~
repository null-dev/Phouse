Use your android phone like a real mouse, not a lame trackpad.

by: nulldev

This project attempts to use the accelerometer as a mouse instead of forcing the user to tap the screen like a touchpad.
This enables you to work much more smoothly.

Be aware that this may damage your phone's camera, I recommend you place a sticky note underneath it or something...

This app is <strong>PROOF OF CONCEPT</strong>!
